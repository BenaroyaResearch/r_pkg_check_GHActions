### Create package in a new directory (RStudio)

Create new project (right top of RStudio or File -> New Project) and select R
package in a new directory. This creates package and the directory structure.
Start with deleting `R/hello.R`, `man/hello.Rd` and `NAMESPACE` files (last one
will be automatically recreated when `devtools::document()` is run).

### Add function

Create R script, write a function with `roxygen` comments (documentation) and 
save the file in `R` directory, e.g.`pkg/R/funct.R`.

To render function documentation and update `NAMESPACE` file, run 
`devtools::document()`.

### Add unit tests

Recommended testing framework is `testthat`. To initialize test file structure,
run `usethis::use_testthat()`. This also adds `testthat` package to `Suggests` 
field in `DESCRIPTION` file. 

Create an R script with unit test and save it as 
`pkg/tests/testthat/test-<funct_name>.R`

To run full test suite locally, use `devtools::test()`

### Update `DESCRIPTION` file

- Add authors, maintainers, title and description,
- update license,
- bump package version.


### initialize GitHub repo

- create new repo on GitHub
- go to your R package directory
- `git init`
- `git branch -m "main"` change name from `master` to `main` if that was the 
default
- `git remote add origin https://github.com/username/reponame`
- `git add <dir1> <file1> ...`
- `git commit -m <commit_msg>`
- `git push origin main`

### GitHub Readme
To create README template run `usethis::use_readme_rmd()`.
Update `README.Rmd`, knit with `Cmd + Shift + Enter` and `commit` `push` both 
files.

### Generate GitHub token

Log in to your github.com account and click on your user, then choose
`Settings`. Select `Developer Settings` at the bottom and then `Personal access
tokens`. Click `Generate new token`. Name the token, set expiration time and
tick `workflow` as scope (and others if needed).

Use this token in your credential manager (Windows) or Keychain access (Mac).
Look for Keychain Access app on your Mac and type `git` in searchbar. Double
click on `github.com` and then the token goes to password field.


### Add GitHub Actions
Run `usethis::use_github_action("check-standard")`

This creates `.github` directory:

```
.github
│   .gitignore
│
└─── workflows
       check-standard.yaml
```

- `.gitignore` specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore by git. Simply 
files you don't want to commit and push to remote repository. Each file is in 
new line and config accepts regex patterns, e.g. `*.html` ignores all html files.
- `workflows` subdirectory with GitHub Actions workflows configuration files,
  - `check-standard.yaml` - workflow configuration file - `R CMD check`. File 
  can be renamed to more informative name, e.g. `R-CMD-check.yaml`. This
  directory can store multiple `.yaml` files for different workflows.

Here are specified branches and events that will trigger the workflow. Default
template is for `main` and `master` only:


```
  on:
  push:
    branches: [main, master]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, master]
```

**_Note:_** to trigger `R CMD check` on every branch, substitute `[main, master]`
with `'**'`.

After pushing to remote repo, go to GitHub Actions and see if the workflow is 
triggered. You can click on each job to see the its' console log.

[Click](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples) for more details 
on GitHub Actions workflows for R.


### GitHub Actions status badge

To generate status badge for your workflow (see the top of this README), go to 
GitHub and repo Actions. Select workflow you want to get badge, click `...` in 
right top corner and then `Create status badge` and copy rmarkdown code.


### GitHub actions examples

`.yaml` files are often used as configuration files. Indentations are part of
the syntax and indicate nesting (like Python).


#### Run R expression

You can add the following examples to previously created `.yaml` file to add
more jobs to existing workflow.

```
# Run R expressions
  R-expr:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: run-R-expr
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@master
      - run: echo $GITHUB_WORKSPACE
      - run: |
          R -e 'print("a");
          # -e flag for "run R expression"
          df <- data.frame(x = 1:10);
          head(df)'
```

What it does:

- `R-expr:` - job name in yaml config file
- `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` - operating system that runs workflow
- `name: run-R-expr` - name of the workflow that appears in repo's GitHub Actions
- `steps:` - opens the section for workflow steps
- `- uses: actions/checkout@v2`
- `- uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@master` - environments/containers that will
check-out to the repository to access it and run GH A workflows. The second is
used to set up and allow to run `R` code in the workflow
- `- run: echo $GITHUB_WORKSPACE` - commands to be run. E.g. `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE`
is a repo internal variable, print current working directory
- `- run: |` - note `|` - it allows to write commands in multiple lines. To run R
code, use `R -e <code`. It opens `R` session inside GH A workflow and runs the 
code. Note the `;` after function calls - this is to separate expressions,
the same as you would run multiple function calls in one line in R studio - 
`print("a"); print("hello")`.


#### Run R expression on multiple versions

This examples lets you run your `R` code on multiple `R` versions.

```
# R expressions on multiple R versions
  R-expr-multi-ver:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        R: [ '3.6.1', '4.1.2', '4.2.0' ]
    name: R ${{ matrix.R }} ver-test
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2
        with:
          r-version: ${{ matrix.R }}
      - run: Rscript -e 'print(sessionInfo()$R.version$version.string)'
```

What is new here:

- creates a version matrix for the job inside `strategy` clause
``` 
strategy:
  matrix:
    R: [ '3.6.1', '4.1.2', '4.2.0' ]
```
an object `matrix.R` is created that will the job for each of the specified
versions here. Note: same strategy was used to test `R-CMD-Check` on multiple
operating systems. 

- `name: R ${{ matrix.R }} ver-test` - name is set for each job. In GH A, you 
will see for example `R 3.6.1 ver-test`. This iteratively updates the name. We 
refer to the matrix object using `${{ }}`
- using `with` lets us use each version from `matrix.R` inside `R` container 
`r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2` we specified.
```
with:
  r-version: ${{ matrix.R }}
```
- `- run: Rscript -e` alternative way is to run `Rscript -e`. Also useful to run
`.R` files, see next sections.


#### Run bash commands

```
# Run bash commands in terminal
  Greetings:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: hello-where-am-i
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - run: echo "Multiple run clause"
      - run: |
         echo "Hello"
         echo "Current workdir is:"
         echo $GITHUB_WORKSPACE
         echo "$(pwd)"
         ls -la
```

This job simply runs `bash` commands. If you go to GH A and see console logs for
the job, you will see printed current working directory twice: using 
`$GITHUB_WORKSPACE` and `"$(pwd)"`. Note: you can simply run bash commands, e.g.
`ls -la` and see the output. We see that as default, working directory is where
`DESCRIPTION` package files is, so package root directory.



#### Run bash script from `.sh` file
```
# Run bash script from inside the repo. Add permission (chmod) before or inside
# this job
  Bash-script:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: run-bash-script
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - run: |
            echo "run script $(pwd)/exec/test_script.sh"
            sh ./exec/test_script.sh
```

You can place a bash script inside your package (here is in `exec` directory)
and run it using GH A workflow. This can be used for example for testing a
typical package workflow using `.sh`.


#### Create another workflow in GH A

If you create another `.yaml` file in `.github/workflows` directory, you will see
another workflow running in your repo.

```
on:
  push:
    branches: '**'
  pull_request:
    branches: '**'

name: R-script
jobs:

  install-R-pkg:
    runs-on: macOS-latest
    name: install-R-pkg
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@master
        with:
          r-version: '4.1.2'
      - run: |
          Rscript $(pwd)/exec/install_script.R
```

Remember that creating a new file, requires us to specify events that trigger
job inside `on:` clause. `name: R-script` this is the name that will appear in
GH Actions workflows. Now we'll see 2: `R-CMD-Check` and `R-script`.

- this workflow runs on `macOS`, similarly is set to use `R` and version is set to
`4.1.2`
- in `run:` clause we specifiy an `R` script that lives inside `exec`
directory
- ***Note:***`R` environment we set here, is not the same
environment you have locally. This is a remote container with `R` and most
probably you don't have many packages (like `dplyr`, `devtools` etc)



### Protected branches

If you want to create a *protected branch*, i.e. branch that cannot be updated
freely by anyone and prevent unintentionally breaking code because of not
checked changes, do the following:

Go to your repo on GitHub and click on `Settings`. Select `Branches`. 

Use branch `main` as your default branch (i.e. cloning repo and creating branches will 
default to `main`). 

Next, click `Add branch protection rule` and tick (recommended):

- `Require a pull request before merging`,
- `Require approvals`,
- `Require status checks to pass before merging`,
- `Require branches to be up to date before merging`.

...and anything else, if you want to be more specific about the repository rules.

Repository owner can merge branches / pull requests without approvals. _With
great power comes great responsibility_ :muscle: :whale2:
